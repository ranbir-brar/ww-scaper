### 1. The Hook (0:00 - 0:10)

**Narrator**: "Stop scrolling through endless pages of tables. Meet WW-Explorer—the job search experience you actually deserve."

### 2. The Dashboard Overview (0:10 - 0:25)

**Visual**: Mouse hovers over the **Metrics Cards** at the top.
**Action**: Point out "Total Jobs", "Average Hourly Wage", and "Less Competition" metrics.

### 3. Smart Filtering (0:25 - 0:45)

**Visual**: Click the **"Filters"** button.
**Action**:

1.  Drag the **Salary Range** slider to \$30+.
2.  Expand the **Region** accordion and select **"USA"** & **"Canada"**.
3.  Click **"Apply Filters"**.
    **Narrator**: "Filter out the noise. Want a tech job in the US or Canada paying over $30 an hour? Done. The filters are powerful, intuitive, and granular."

### 4. Deep Dive & Unknown Handling (0:45 - 0:55)

**Visual**: Scroll through the list. Click on a **Job Card** to open the **Detail Modal**.

### 5. Analytics & Insights (0:55 - 1:10)

**Visual**: Click the **"Analytics"** tab.
**Action**: Hover over the **Salary Distribution** chart and the **Skills Bar Chart**.
