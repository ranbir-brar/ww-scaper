We in the office 3 times a week. Students are welcome to use the office at anytime as we have 24 hour access.\n\nWork Term Duration:\n\n4 month work term\n\nJob Summary:\n\nThe Problem\nWe're lazy. We hate doing the same thing over and over again. We hate doing work that can and should be automated. We've suffered through it. We don't even want to search for an answer - we want to be proactively told the solution.\n\nThe fastest growing technical companies have a critical group of people that are dealing with this problem - the sales engineers, solution architects, customer success engineers and everyone they serve on revenue teams.\n\nThey're inundated by questions from colleagues & customers. They are stuck filling out similar security questionnaires & RFPs. They spend hours writing \"handoff\" docs and \"prep\" for meetings. They're still waiting for an answer that they asked a colleague yesterday.\n\nThis wasted time is expensive and makes providing great experiences to customers and prospects unnecessarily challenging.\n\nThis is what we're solving. At Mash, we're building the tools to help revenue teams at technical B2B companies scale the tier-one service they provide to customers and prospects. From an encyclopedic knowledge engine that pulls in information from all the scattered, siloed and messy sources, to the automation agents that proactively help before they know they need it. Help us help them… be lazy!\n\nAbout Mash\nWe're a dynamic team with experience at startups, and big tech including Google, Amazon, D2L, Ross Intelligence & Lazer. We don't use any seniority titles, and plan not to for as long as feasibly possible (learn more why).\nMash has ample runway having raised a US$6M seed round from top VCs and angels. The round was co-led by Whitecap Venture Partners and Castle Island Ventures, with participation from Maple VC, Strategic Cyber Ventures, Aquanow, Spacecadet Ventures, and angel investors including Amjad Masad, Balaji Srinivasan, Austin Hill, and John Pfeffer.\n\nCultural Fit\nWe treat your time as the scarce asset that it is. We respect people being heads down and having the time to get into a flow. Distractions and context switching are things we work to minimize. We have meetings for specific purposes, and leverage async channels as is often appropriate.\nMash has an open and direct culture. We believe that not making a decision is a decision - and a terrible one at that. We have strong conviction and a bias for action. We can agree to disagree and move forward after reviewing the details. As we learn, we will re-evaluate, iterate and push forward.\n\nWe're looking for an individual who -\n\nResponds well to open-ended problems, thrives on autonomy, and is a self-starter and problem solver.\nExcels in team environments and is focused on team goals.\nHas great communication skills.\n\nJob Responsibilities:\n\nRole & Responsibilities\n\nBuild, test, and ship end-to-end product features.\nWork closely with a cross-functional team (product, design, engineering).\nParticipate in system architecture and technical design discussions.\nManage infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines.\nExamples of Problems We're Tackling:\nDeveloping integrations to seamlessly connect diverse data sources, enabling the transformation and indexing of data into vector databases and full-text search platforms for efficient search and retrieval.\nLeveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide accurate, timely, context-aware knowledge to sales and customer support representatives.\nOur Stack\nApplication: TypeScript, Python, Tailwind CSS, NextJS, Postgres\n\nRequired Skills:\n\nSkill Set\n\nSkilled in 1 or more modern backend programming languages, such as Go, Java, C++, C#, Python, etc.\nSkilled in web development (JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and frameworks such as React, Vue, etc.)\nExperience with relational databases (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.).\nExperience with cloud providers (such as Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, etc.).\nBonus: Data processing pipelines, LLMs and related tooling (such as OpenAI, Cohere, LangChain, vector stores, etc.)\n\nTransportation and Housing:\n\nWork Environment\nMash is a hybrid-remote company. We spend an average of 2-3 days per week in-office in downtown Toronto. We do this deliberately as a startup to balance impactful collaboration with effective heads-down time. We value in-person discussions and focused team sessions, but also understand the need for reasonable flexibility to work when/where it fits best into your life.\n\nCompensation and Benefits:\n\nMash provides competitive compensation based on the average earnings posted by the University of Waterloo here. Take your work term and program you are in and we will target the upper end of average.\n\nExample: If you are a Computer Science student going in into work term 5, the salary range will be $50 - 60 / hour\n\nTargeted Degrees and Disciplines:\n\nView Targeted Degrees and Disciplines",

This role is ideal for a student who enjoys building systems, improving processes, and learning how a growing company actually runs day-to-day.\n\nRole Overview\nThis co-op role is designed for a student who wants exposure to real operational systems, not theoretical case studies. This role will allow the co-op student to drive improvements and changes in all departments required for business operations. You will be exposed to real decision-making, real constraints, and real outcomes-this is not a \"busywork\" role..\n\nYou will work directly with the Director of Operations on building, refining, and documenting the tools that run the business. This is a hands-on, systems-driven role with tangible deliverables that will be used daily by project teams and leadership.\n\nMost co-op roles focus on one narrow function.

All Fellows are expected to show up in person in downtown Toronto (Union Station area) for the Bootcamp week, weekly Expert workshops and Group Office Hours. Given that learning is generally more effective in person, we recommend Fellows being in the office at least 3 days per week. Some Fellows may have additional on-site requirements for clients in the Toronto area. Some projects may involve occasional (optional) travel to the US for meetings.\n\nWork Term Duration:\n\n4 month work term\n\nSpecial Work Term Start/End Date Considerations:\n\n4-month and 8-month placements are available.\n\nJob Summary:\n\nAscendance Foundry is built on two beliefs: 1) apprenticeship belongs at the centre of education, and 2) winning with AI demands the fastest workforce retraining in history. We help companies across many industries learn how to leverage modern AI tools to transform their businesses through a unique consulting model that incorporates structured learning, opening up new revenue opportunities while gaining operational efficiency. Ascendance Fellows are recruited from amongst the top students who have completed 2 years of University or less, and are paired with clients on focused transformation projects, while both receiving structured mentorship from seasoned founders, executives, and technical leaders.\n\nProgram Overview:\nThe Ascendance Fellowship is a fully paid, elite apprenticeship where you dive into real-world projects from day one. Fellows train with AI tools, deliver impact inside top companies, and learn from industry leaders. With expert mentorship, an ambitious peer network, and no tuition, it's a launchpad to an accelerated, high-impact career.\n\nWeek 1: Intensive AI-Bootcamp: Intensive training in AI tools and development workflows. Hands-on projects with LLMs, automation, and data pipelines.\nWeeks 2-16+ (Client Project Placement). Apply AI-native practices to deliver high-impact results, embedded in a real-world role at a client company.\nWeekly Expert Workshops. Learn directly from industry leaders and technical mentors from our Expert Network, which includes senior technical leaders, AI experts and business leaders from across several industries.\nWeekly Group Office Hours: Get together weekly with peers and mentors to help debug each other's day-to-day work.\nOn-Demand Mentorship & Customized Training. Ongoing 1:1 mentorship throughout the term. Personalized support on tools, techniques, and project challenges. Customized training to match the scope of the project.\n\nTypes of projects available:\nThe types of projects available vary from term to term, depending on the needs of our clients, but generally fall into three broad categories: a) Strategy & Management Consulting, b) Analytics & Data Science, c) Custom Application Development. While not all projects available to Fellows will be finalized and contracted by Match date, here is a representative sample of projects we are working on now. In addition to the types of projects below, there will be at least one opening focused internally on improving our educational programming and expanding our reach with industry.\n\nProject Examples:\n1. Building an automation strategy for a large global legal process outsourcing firm: This project focuses on transforming a legal process outsourcing firm, into a Business Process Automation (BPA) firm through strategic AI adoption, through a combination of off-the-shelf software solutions and custom middleware. Fellows will play a key role in developing and implementing AI-driven solutions to enhance efficiency, expand service offerings, and build a comprehensive AI strategy for presentation to prospective buyers. This is a unique opportunity to contribute to a forward-thinking initiative at the intersection of legal technology and cutting-edge AI.\n\n2. Building accounting and project management automations for a mid-sized construction company: This project is similar in scope to Project 1, except for a mid-sized Canadian construction company. We are helping the company develop and build out their automation strategy from the ground floor, focusing on their accounting and project management functions, enabling them to price and forecast projects more accurately, while delivering more efficiently.\n\n3. Building and managing Ascendance Foundry's proprietary trading fund: We have launched a proprietary trading fund that our Fellows help us manage, which tests and executes several trading strategies (med-long-term bets on secular trends, event-based strategies, etc).\n\n4. Building a sales and coaching agent for Ascendance Foundry: One of the consequences of mass AI adoption is that many more brick and mortar businesses will be able to design and build their own hyper-customized automations without having to hire large consulting firms or build large internal engineering teams. However, doing so requires mastering a whole new operating language and building small strike teams of SMEs and Forward-Deployed engineers with a different combination of skillsets. We are building an agent that helps teach prospective clients how to get started on this journey. This will be used to drive new sales as well as to guide our existing Fellow-client teams.\n\nJob Responsibilities:\n\nResponsibilities will vary somewhat with the type of project placement, but generally fall into three buckets:\n\nStrategy & Management Consulting - support market analyses, research on specific companies, and conduct financial analysis to inform client recommendations. They will also assist in preparing decks, proposals, and business cases while collaborating with the team to evaluate strategic options and organize client meetings and workshops.\nAnalytics & Data Science - assist with data collection, cleaning, and analysis, while supporting the development of models and visualizations to extract insights. They will collaborate with the team to document findings, test methodologies, and apply statistical and machine learning techniques to real-world datasets.\nCustom application development - support coding, testing, and debugging of application features while assisting with research, documentation, and deployment activities. They will work closely with the development team in an agile environment, gaining hands-on experience with modern tools, best practices, and real-world software engineering workflows.\n\nRequired Skills:\n\nWe don't expect our Fellows to come in with a long list of skills coming into the program (building foundational skills and a network is the whole point of the program), but we expect you to show up everyday with an attitude that lives up to our brand ideals:\n\n\"Driven, Agile, Resourceful AF.

Based in California with a Canadian office in Burnaby, British Columbia. It is run by Silicon Valley veterans and industry titans Andy Bechtolsheim, Ken Duda, and Jayshree Ullal. Arista is developing a new class of integrated network solutions to address the scalability, performance, and reliability requirements of large-scale high performance computing and cloud datacenters. Arista plays a key role in the datacenters of companies ranging from Facebook to Microsoft, from AOL to Comcast, from ESPN to Netflix, from Citigroup to Morgan Stanley.\n\nCheck out https://www.arista.com/en/careers/university/engineering-internship to learn more about our internship program.\n\nWhat's Cool at Arista?\n*Cloud* *Software Defined Networks* *Network Virtualization*\nEmpowered engineers. Our engineers are empowered with full responsibility for their projects. Our management structure is flat and lightweight -- you are in charge of delivering your work from design to code to test to customer shipment.\n\nInsane amount of automation! We have run close to 20 million tests in our mini-data center that operates 24/7. We put a premium on building and using tools that make everyone super-productive. This translates into quicker turn around times on new features and products for increased revenue with smaller teams.\n\nWe value openness. No part of the company is off-limits, meaning that our engineers have the chance to work on a variety of different areas. All our interns have the same responsibility as our full timers and get to work side-by-side on important, customer-impacting projects.\n\nJob Responsibilities:\n\nThe Job\nSoftware engineers at Arista deliver product features. The core responsibility is writing the code that drives our products. A software engineer is more than just a coding machine; they drive the whole development process including\n\nDeciding the features to build\nDriving the design\nWriting the code (duh!) and testing\nDocumenting the feature\nSupporting customers in the field\n\nAlong the way, you might\nExtend and improve the test infrastructure\nHack on our engineering tools, including p4, django, python, rpm, ...\nWork with sales and business development\n\nExample Projects\nWe don't have time for busy work: every project that we do has customers clamoring for it. Along with quick release cycles and an engineer-oriented culture means we always have a slew of interesting projects to tackle. What project you'll work on at Arista will vary a lot depending on our customer demands and your interests. Here are some sample potential projects:\n\n1) Latency Based Routing (Networking Protocol)\n\nOur switches run routing protocols that program the hardware with the nexthop for forwarding packets. The nexthop determination is based on some metric of proximity or cost to the destination. For example, the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol relies on the Dijkstra's algorithm to minimize the number of hops to reach a destination.\n\nWith Latency Based Routing, the preferred path to a destination has the lowest aggregate delay across several hops. Precautions must be taken to ensure that the protocol converges fast on network events and stable to avoid constant changes in the preferred path. This feature is important for latency sensitive applications run by, for example, financial customers who connect to stock exchanges in multiple locations (New York, Chicago, Tokyo) and demand the lowest delays for receiving market information.\n\n2) Redefining Load Balancing for Future Applications (Networking Protocol)\n\nThe Internet is glued together by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP) has been the backbone of resilient network topologies by allowing multiple paths to a destination. With ECMP, the failure of a few links have little impact as the traffic transitions to the remaining links.\nCustomers are now demanding link bandwidth aware traffic load balancing through the Unequal Cost Multi Path (UCMP) extension to BGP which is cutting-edge technology on track to become an RFC standard. The project involves adding ability to match and set/tweak bandwidth advertisements in the BGP policy engine to allow UCMP formation.\n\n3) Shared Strings (Software Infrastructure)\n\nArista is always concerned about memory efficiency as our switches don't have hard drives, and thus cannot page memory to disk. This means that when you run out of memory, you are hosed. And, as we add more features, we consume more memory. One way we could possibly reduce memory is shared strings. This would be a table per process that contains all unique strings instantiated. Whenever you go to instantiate a new string this table would be checked to see if that string already exists and if so, return a pointer to it. This table would have to be very efficient both in speed and size. Another benefit of this approach is that string comparisons could be very fast: O(1) address comparisons instead of O(length of string) character comparisons.\n\n4) Programmable Operating System on a Switch (Software Defined Networks)\n\nEOS SDK: Arista's EOS operating system is the first truly extensible network operating system on top of Linux. In addition to the standard Linux APIs, the SDK provides a set of higher-level APIs to enable third party developers to write their agents that run in EOS. It's a set of stable, versioned APIs published on GitHub, available both in C++ and Python. Our largest cloud customers leverage EOS SDK to integrate their custom orchestration, automated-management, and provisioning systems with Arista switches.\nA significant fraction of today's Internet traffic is delivered to you using custom SDN applications that the largest cloud companies such as Netflix or Facebook built using EOS SDK. Projects here involve significant contributions to the maturing EOS SDK by developing new APIs to configure EOS. Your changes will be on GitHub in our EosSdk repository!\n\n5) Rethinking and Redesigning (The Go Revolution)\n\nArista has a large C++ and Python codebase. Over the past year we've been implementing a lot of building blocks in Go in order to make this language a third option in our tool box. This project gives you the chance to rethink in pretty fundamental ways how various key software components in EOS work under the hood as Go enables us to easily explore alternate development and concurrency models. Come join the Go revolution at Arista.\n\n6) In-service FPGA Upgrade of Modular Components (Talking to Hardware)\n\nArista's modular systems have hot swappable components which are inserted or removed on run-time with little performance impact to the system. Such components have FPGAs that are programmed by the hardware team and we would like the ability to easily and reliably upgrade the FPGA image on our products in the field with latest enhancements. This project will give you a chance to get really close to hardware and understand how the system initializes itself.\n\n7) VMTracer ACLs (Cloud Datacenter)\n\nArista is dedicated to supporting datacenter deployments of our customers. Our integration with a VMWare server keeps the switch informed of the MAC addresses of different virtual machines. The switch monitors the traffic to locate and detect migrations of virtual machines. With this VMTracer capability, an EOS switch can keep specified virtual machines in the same virtual LAN (VLAN) segment.\nThe VMTracer ACLs project provides the ability to seamlessly migrate Access Control List configuration for virtual machines when they migrate. A simple access control list, for example, allows traffic on port 80 for web-server virtual machines or on port 3306 for MySql virutal machines.\n\n8) KernelNetworkInfo agent (Kernel related)\n\nInitially we had a state machine to pull the interfaces/ip addresses/ARP state from the kernel. This state machine had to be instantiated for each VRF in a lot of agents. The state machine setup a netlink socket with the kernel (for each VRF) which created a lot of contention on a lock in the kernel because we had lots of agents that needed to be notified for each configuration change. To address this, the KernelNetworkInfo agent was created that is responsible for getting the kernel state and pushing it into user address space. This way we only have one netlink socket per VRF in KernelNetworkInfo and all the agents could use the same information to read/react on the kernel state. That helped drastically reduce the contention and solved a lot of issues that were caused by that such as processes getting blocked.\n\nMore Info\nYou can find out more information about Arista on our website at http://www.arista.com/en/careers/university.\n\nRequired Skills:\n\nThe Ideal Candidate\n\nLoves to program and finds satisfaction in creating a well-written piece of code\nDoesn't shy away from hard problems and enjoys the challenge of making reliable software\nWants to work side-by-side with the brightest minds in software, systems, and hardware\nLearns how things work, just for fun or out of curiosity\nCares about the business too\n\nYou have (or want to have) experience with some set of\nC / C++\nPython\nGo\nHardware / drivers / embedded systems\nNetwork protocols such as TCP/IP, Ethernet\nLinux\n\nTransportation and Housing:\n\n$2000 CAD for relocation expenses.\n3 days a week in office attendance\n\nCompensation and Benefits:\n\n- $6500 CAD a month.\n\nTargeted Degrees and Disciplines:\n\nView Targeted Degrees and Disciplines",

As AI has advanced, Warp has evolved beyond its terminal roots into the platform for Agentic Development: a workbench for dispatching agents to code, deploy, and debug production software.\n\nWith over half a million active developers and revenue that has grown 23x this year so far, we are in a unique position to impact the future of development. We believe that engineers at any level will be \"tech leads\" for groups of agents; rather than opening a code editor to write code or a terminal to write commands, they will open Warp and prompt their computer to build features, fix bugs, and diagnose production issues.\n\nWith its starting point as a reimagined command line, Warp is well-positioned to support agent-first workflows: It sits at the lowest level in the dev stack, has access to all of a developer's context, and is set up for multitasking and long-running processes. In addition, Warp has state-of-the-art code editing features and built-in team knowledge sharing. It's the right interface for the agentic future.\n\nOur mission has remained the same even as AI has advanced: to empower developers to ship better software more quickly, freeing them to focus on the creative and rewarding aspects of their work.\n\nWe are looking for outstanding, product-focused engineering interns who want to work on difficult technical problems with the goal of improving developers' lives. You'll be working in Rust and Go with an experienced, kind, and thoughtful team of gifted engineers.\n\nFor more information on our team and culture, we highly recommend reading our How We Work.\n\nJob Responsibilities:\n\nParticipate in all aspects of software development activities, including design, coding, code review, unit/integration testing, bug fixing, and code/API documentation.\nCollaborate closely with the rest of engineering, as well as other stakeholders from our growth, marketing, and product teams, to plan features and build a high quality product that elevates the productivity of all developers.\nImprove Warp's performance and reliability by building new features or polishing existing parts of the product.\nPrototype ideas and concepts to get quick feedback from internal and external users\nWork across the entire technical stack to ensure users have the most efficient and delightful experience using Warp. The features you develop will span all aspects of the user experience, making you an expert on what their needs are.\nProvide thoughtful feedback to your peers, and build strong personal connections with your teammates!\n\nRequired Skills:\n\nYou are passionate about helping developers get more done - would jump at the chance to work on this particular product\nYou have amazing engineering chops, but are also product- and user-focused\nYou have great communication and collaboration skills\nYou're sensitive to developers' needs, and can develop warm relationships with developers\nBonus:\nBuilding native apps in Rust or WASM\nShell or Linux-programming\nServer-side programming in go\nOpenGL, WebG, or other graphics programming\n\nTransportation and Housing:\n\nWe provide a $7,000 relocation stipend if you choose to move to either SF or NYC for your internship.\n\nCompensation and Benefits:\n\n$10,400/month USD\n\nTargeted Degrees and Disciplines:\n\nView Targeted Degrees and Disciplines",

Be aware of mandatory and other requirements for students working outside Canada.\n\nFor specific information on the USA visa process that affects co-op employment, refer to our USA Work Permit/J-1 Visa webpage (opens in a new window).\n\nJob Summary:\n\nSummary\n\nRole: Software engineer (backend-focused) at a YC/Accel-backed, high-growth, early-stage startup.\n\nCompany: We're a fast-growing, YC-backed startup modernizing one of the world's largest, most complex industries. Construction relies on outdated systems, disconnected tools, and manual workflows. Agave is a product platform providing data infrastructure and workflow automation around the construction ERP. Our founding team has worked together for 10 years, first at Graphiq (acq. by Amazon) then at Amazon.\n\nWhy join us?\nAt Agave, you'll work alongside a team of exceptional engineers where you'll work on hard problems.\n\nLearn 10x faster than anywhere else: from day one, you'll ship code that touches real customers, work closely with our customers, and get direct feedback from seasoned engineers who care deeply about your growth. You'll learn a ton and have outsized ownership.\nSolve high-leverage problems: all of our engineers tackle some of the hardest, most rewarding challenges in infrastructure, data architecture, and systems design. You'll help build the infrastructure that powers millions of real-time data syncs across critical tools. We treat co-ops like full-time employees; you'll have the opportunity to work on interesting projects that have a real business and customer impact.\nLow risk, huge upside: We're profitable, cash flow positive, scaling fast, and backed by top investors (YC, Accel, founders of Plaid, etc.).\nHave fun! This is our second time hosting Waterloo co-ops (our first batch of 3 will actually be joining us full-time after graduation). From baseball games at Oracle park to mini golf to team dinners, we'll do everything we can to make you feel like a critical part of the team here.\nLearn more about the industry and opportunity here.\n\nJob Responsibilities:\n\nYou'll work on a variety of technical projects spanning these areas:\n\nUnification: we're unifying dozens-to-hundreds of fragmented systems under a single standard that we define. Our unification covers data objects, data models, authentication, account-linking UX, and features like filters and pagination. When designing any new feature, we have to do it in a scalable way. For example, when adding filters, we have to research each system we support (and plan to support) and create a generic, system-agnostic solution.\n\nOn-prem systems: we're connecting with many types of on-prem systems (SQL-based, DLL-based, API-based), many built 20-40 years ago. We provide tremendous value to customers allowing them to interface with these systems in a secure, fast, reliable way, as if they're modern, cloud-based products. We need to support real-time communication and webhooks when they don't exist (e.g., using web-sockets).\n\nScale & speed: we're handling millions of API requests per day and growing daily. For our products that we power with our own API (e.g. Analytics), we need to store and retrieve large amounts of data in an efficient way, building elegant caching layers to reduce latency. We ship code daily and iterate quickly based on actual feedback from paying customers (they share tons!).\n\nOperational excellence: we're creating a reliable API layer on top of many old systems that don't have APIs. It's like building a skyscraper on quicksand, enforced by SLAs. We need to innovate in expanding the depth and breadth of our integrations while simultaneously increasing our development velocity. We need to be very creative in how to continually test our code and integrations, creating scalable testing frameworks that can catch edge cases and bugs across 1k+ endpoints.\n\nMix of back-end and front-end: we're building front-end apps that dog-food our own APIs (e.g. Sync, Analytics). This helps us build world-class APIs because we suffer any pain present in our API. We're building both the lego blocks and the higher-level lego models: we see what kinds of APIs our SaaS customers want, then also look at the kinds of API niceties we want for our own applications (like a caching layer, advanced filtering) and implement a combination of the two.\n\nVariety: without knowing, you might assume adding a new integration is low-ambiguity and routine. But each integration we launch is special, completely different and posing unique challenges. This requires researching that system and its nuances in great depth before building on top of it. It's part engineering, part archeology.\n\nRequired Skills:\n\nBack-end/full-stack engineer\nAt least 2 co-ops at software companies\nSelf-motivated, high ownership, low ego. Desire to work on a fast-paced, intense, fun team.\nPumped to work in-person with us in SF 5 days/week.\nNo need to have: prior experience with our tech stack or at B2B SaaS/dev tools companies\n\nTransportation and Housing:\n\nWe will cover the cost of your flight to and from San Francisco. You will be expected to find your own housing.\n\nCompensation and Benefits:\n\nCompensation:\nCash range: $8-10k USD per month\n\nBenefits:\nGym: on-site gym with Peloton, squat rack, Tempo, Yoga setup, and more.\nVisa: we sponsor Visas (H1B, TN, etc.) for candidates who are a good fit to return full-time.\nFood: daily DoorDash stipend for dinner. Ample on-site snacks & drinks!\nHealthcare: we cover 90% of your healthcare costs with several plan options.\n\nTargeted Degrees and Disciplines:\n\nView Targeted Degrees and Disciplines",

Be aware of mandatory and other requirements for students working outside Canada.\n\nFor specific information on the USA visa process that affects co-op employment, refer to our USA Work Permit/J-1 Visa webpage (opens in a new window).\n\nJob Summary:\n\nSequence exists to empower the next industrial revolution with applied AI.\n\nWe are building a new kind of holding company that acquires and operates traditional businesses, and rebuilds them with AI and cutting edge technologies. Think of us as Blackstone meets Palantir.\n\nOwnership is our superpower. When you own the business, you can align incentives, eliminate inertia, and redesign operations from first principles. That is what makes us the ultimate applied AI company.\n\nWe are not another AI roll up, and we are not stitching together small scattered assets. We acquire businesses that matter and elevate them through deep transformation, turning incumbents into AI native leaders.\n\nThe ambition is nothing less than a generational company, and we will not stop until we achieve our mission. We are building the Berkshire Hathaway of the AI era.\n\nThe Team\n\nWe've assembled an exceptional team for an enormous opportunity:\n\n- CEO and Co-Founder: Michael Lee was previously the Head of Private Investments at Lone Pine Capital, an $18 billion investment firm.\n- Co-Founder: Alex Rubin is a former product and engineering leader at Scale AI, where he led the Code RLHF business and co-led the International Public Sector business.\n- Investment Team: Deep transaction experience from top-tier firms including Centerbridge, TPG and Silver Lake.\n- Engineering: Technical talent from high-velocity, forward-deployed environments like Scale AI and Palantir.\n\nWhy Ownership Matters\n\n- Ownership drives real change: Companies inherently resist significant change. Consultants and software vendors are blocked by internal politics. By owning businesses outright, we bypass organizational friction and rapidly execute deep, meaningful transformations.\n- Transformation creates significant equity value: Early AI adoption drives step-function improvements in margins and multiples. Ownership ensures we capture the entirety of this equity value creation-rather than just collecting recurring SaaS fees.\n- Build better agents: Effective AI requires ground-truth data. Unlike software vendors who must accept messy client data, full ownership allows us to redesign data collection and incentive systems from scratch. This enables recursively improving AI agents that continuously enhance performance and compound in value.\n\nWhat We're Building\n\n- Autonomous AI agents: We build agents tailored to specific industry workflows-autonomously performing tasks, learning from proprietary data, and proactively optimizing processes without human intervention.\n- Scalable AI infrastructure: A unified platform and standardized data stack that connect every company we acquire, making integration fast and repeatable. This allows us to deploy AI solutions quickly, reuse capabilities across the portfolio, and compound improvements as the system learns from each transformation.\n- The Compute-Driven P&L: We are shifting industries from human-heavy operating models toward scalable, compute-driven structures. This frees up capital for innovation, better customer experiences, and aggressive reinvestment.\n\nWhy Competitors Struggle\n\n- Private equity limitations: Traditional PE is constrained by short-term horizons and a lack of technical DNA. They struggle to attract elite engineering talent or execute genuine operational change, often settling for financial engineering over technological transformation.\n- Incumbent constraints: Whether public or private, established companies are paralyzed by inertia. They view AI as a simple software add-on rather than a fundamental operational overhaul. Furthermore, they lack the cultural DNA to attract elite technical talent, leaving them unable to execute the complex, ground-up transformations required to survive.\n\nYou Should Join If\n\n- You are deeply motivated by real world impact. You recognize that AI's potential is often trapped in flashy, but non-substantive pilots, and are motivated to find ways to build and deploy technology that genuinely transforms the physical economy. In exchange, we'll help you directly capture the equity value you create.\n- You are eager to take extreme ownership. You don't just want to write code; you want to influence organizational change and business outcomes.\n- You're interested in working hard with an ambitious and a world-class team seeking to upend how companies currently compete.\n\nThe Culture\n\nWe work hard and hold ourselves accountable. Extraordinary outcomes demand sustained effort from exceptional individuals dedicated to ambitious goals.\n\nHere is what we expect:\n\n- Work 6 days a week (Mon-Fri In-person; Sun Remote).\n- No egos. The best idea wins.\n- We value individuals who find a way to get things done, regardless of blockers.\n\nOur investors\n\nWe have raised ~$30 million from top tier investors including:\n\n- Conviction (Seed co-lead)\n- 8VC (Seed co-lead)\n- Chris Re (Founding advisor)\n- Avenir\n\nJob Responsibilities:\n\nPartner with clients to deeply understand their challenges and define AI-driven solutions\nBuild agents, LLM applications, and API integrations that automate real workflows\nParticipate in customer engagements, including occasional travel\nScope out and build end-to-end AI applications into production, leveraging computer vision, language models, including fine-tuning and optimization\n\nRequired Skills:\n\nExperience with backend technologies (Python, FastAPI) and frontend technologies & frameworks (React, Typescript)\nExperience with LLM frameworks: LangChain, vector databases, etc.\nFamiliarity with cloud-based platforms (e.g. GCP, AWS)\nUnderstanding of training/fine tuning and data quality\nAPIs, Docker/Kubernetes, cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure), CI/CD, observability\n\nCompensation and Benefits:\n\n$10,000 - 12,500 (USD) / month + $2,000 (USD) / month for housing\n\nLunch and dinner covered.\n\nTargeted Degrees and Disciplines:\n\nView Targeted Degrees and Disciplines",

At the same time, the rising integration of renewable energy sources into the electrical grid is leading to the replacement of centralized power plants with a multitude of decentralized generation units (DGUs). The volatile nature of these units intensifies the need for stabilizing the overall system, as every connection or disconnection, and every fluctuation in power input, can significantly disrupt grid dynamics. Stabilizing these microgrids through DGU control is one of the focal research topics at the Institute of Control Systems. Within the present project, already developed DGU-controllers shall be compared in simulation-based benchmark studies. The focus of this comparison will extend beyond mere controller performance, which has already been analyzed to a certain extent. Instead, the objective is to identify or develop new metrics that evaluate the applicability of the controllers with respect to system integration. These metrics may include, for example, the required control energy, line currents, or similar indicators. An essential part of the work package will involve configuring the controllers in a way that ensures a fair and meaningful comparison, while also addressing and critically discussing the comparability criteria themselves.\n\nJob Responsibilities:\n\nTasks:\n\nTraining in modelling of DC microgrids and DGUs\nIntroduction to the DGU controllers\nDevelopment of metrics evaluating the feasibility and quality of the integration of the DGU controllers\nController configuration and development of comparability criteria\nBenchmark study design, execution and analysis\nLearning Outcomes:\nProfessional Skills by: using Matlab and application of control engineering knowledge to research problems; designing an experiment; participating in ongoing research activities\nIntercultural competences and social skills by: collaborating in an international team; absolving an internship abroad\nProblem solving skills by: taking responsibility for a work package and developing strategies to successfully complete it\n\nRequired Skills:\n\nRequirements:\n\nKnowledge in Electrical Engineering is required\nKnowledge in Systems and Control Engineering is required\nKnowledge in Electrical Power Systems may be helpful but it is no prerequisite\nSoftware skills:\nKnowledge in Matlab/Simulink is helpful but no prerequisite\nKnowledge in Latex is strongly desirable\nOther skills:\nThe ability to independent problem solving is desirable\n\nTransportation and Housing:\n\nKarlsruhe - Approximate cost of living for a student (per month)\nFood (groceries + restaurant food): about EUR 160\nRent: EUR 750\nTransportation: EUR 63\nOther expenses (telephone/internet, study materials, recreation, leisure): about EUR 130\nTelephone / Internet / radio and TV license / postage: about EUR 30\nRecreation, culture and sports: EUR 65\nLeisure activities (e.g. 1 cinema ticket with student discount): EUR 6-10\nTOTAL (approx.): EUR 1,100-1,110\n(average: EUR 1,101)\n\nCompensation and Benefits:\n\nStudents will be compensated 1,393 euros per month as a scholarship from IMPULSE-Program.\nIMPULSE - an International Mobility Program with partner universities leading in science and engineering.\n\nCampus Life @ KIT:\nKIT has a lot to offer outside of research laboratories and lecture halls.

Please see more information at https://uwaterloo.ca/student-awards-financial-aid/undergraduate-awards/international-experience-awards\n\nJob Summary:\n\nAbstract of the Project:\n\nOne-Sentence-Summary: Develop and demonstrate a stability-aware, machine-learning-based thermal model for individual apartments, enabling scalable, modular integration into smart heating control systems.\n\nHeating in residential buildings consumes substantial energy, leading to high costs and significant greenhouse gas emissions. Retrofitting insulation or upgrading heat generators can be effective but is often infeasible or prohibitively expensive for existing buildings. As a complementary and near-term measure, smart, networked sensing and control, such as zone temperature sensors combined with smart valves, can reduce heat demand at comparatively low cost and later be enhanced with envelope or producer improvements.\nWithin the D2HeaTEC project, 70-100 apartments will be equipped with multi-zone sensing. The resulting dataset will capture apartment-level thermal dynamics and occupant comfort preferences. In parallel, dynamic parameters of the production and distribution systems will also be measured. Among other applications, this data is expected to support the design and operation of highly efficient room temperature controllers. We plan to investigate a model predictive control (MPC) approach, which requires accurate and scalable models, hence we will focus on modeling initially.\n\nTo ensure scalability for large deployments, we pursue a modular architecture: a physics-based, first-principles model for production and distribution will be combined with a machine-learning (ML) model for each apartment. The per-apartment model must be (i) stable (ideally passive) by design, (ii) compatible with supervisory control, and (iii) easy to integrate with other network modules.\n\nThis project focuses on the design and demonstration of the per-apartment ML module. The student will analyze available data, define consistent input/output interfaces, select and justify a stability-aware ML structure (e.g., port-Hamiltonian or dissipativity-cons trained models), and build a training and evaluation pipeline that supports modular composition, scalability, and continuous or repeated (re)training. The final results should be a small demonstration using preliminary data, showcasing how the learned apartment model can be trained efficiently, evaluated for performance, and integrated with other network models.\n\nJob Responsibilities:\n\nTasks:\n\nPlan the ML structure\nDefine modular interfaces by specifying input/output signals for the apartment model, ensuring compatibility with existing plans for other network components.\nSelect and justify a stability-aware ML approach that enforces at least stability, and ideally passivity (e.g., Port-Hamiltonian networks, Lyapunov/dissipativity-constrained models).\nImplement the chosen ML model structure.\nDesign a scalable training pipeline\nInclude preprocessing steps such as time alignment, noise handling, and missing data treatment.\nDevelop a strategy for incremental or continuous retraining as new data becomes available.\nEnsure the pipeline supports modular integration with the overall network model.\nImplement a minimal demonstration\nTrain and evaluate the ML model on preliminary data.\nCompare performance against simple baselines (e.g., RC models; some implementations are available).\nDocument performance metrics and verify stability properties.\nDocument and present results\nPrepare a technical report summarizing the approach, findings, and limitations.\nDeliver reproducible, version-controlled code.\nGive a short presentation.\nLearning Outcomes:\nTechnical skills:\nUnderstanding of heating systems and thermal building modeling and dynamics.\nSetup of machine learning structures for dynamical systems (stable RNNs, Neural ODEs, physics-informed ML).\nUnderstanding Control theoretic concepts (passivity, modularity, MPC basics).\nTools and workflows:\nUsage of a standard ML Framework (e.g. Pyhton/NumPy/Pandas/PyTourch/JAX or Jula/Flux.jl/DiffEqFlux.jl)\nApplication of git for version control.\nUsage of typesetting systems for scientific reporting (e.g. LaTeX).\nProfessional skills:\nIntercultural collaboration and communication.\nProject Management.\nProblem-solving in open-ended research tasks.\n\nRequired Skills:\n\nRequirements:\n\nSome background knowledge in Control Systems and/or System Dynamics.\nFoundational understanding of Machine Learning, ideally for time-series or dynamic systems.\nMathematical skills (linear algebra, ODEs).\nSoftware skills:\nProgramming in at least one high-level language (Python or Julia preferred).\nFamiliarity with at least one ML framework (PyTorch/JAX/Flux.jl) preferred\nGit for version control.\nSome scientific typesetting tool (LaTeX or Typst preferred)\nOther skills:\nAbility to handle pseudonymized personal data responsibly.\nTechnical writing and visualization.\nSelf-directed learning and time management.\n\nTransportation and Housing:\n\nKarlsruhe - Approximate cost of living for a student (per month)\nFood (groceries + restaurant food): about EUR 160\nRent: EUR 750\nTransportation: EUR 63\nOther expenses (telephone/internet, study materials, recreation, leisure): about EUR 130\nTelephone / Internet / radio and TV license / postage: about EUR 30\nRecreation, culture and sports: EUR 65\nLeisure activities (e.g. 1 cinema ticket with student discount): EUR 6-10\nTOTAL (approx.): EUR 1,100-1,110\n(average: EUR 1,101)\n\nCompensation and Benefits:\n\nStudents will be compensated 1,393 euros per month as a scholarship from IMPULSE-Program.\nIMPULSE - an International Mobility Program with partner universities leading in science and engineering.\n\nCampus Life @ KIT:\nKIT has a lot to offer outside of research laboratories and lecture halls.

Please see more information at https://uwaterloo.ca/student-awards-financial-aid/undergraduate-awards/international-experience-awards\n\nJob Summary:\n\nAbstract of the Project:\n\nThe energy transition requires participation at all levels of society, especially households are encouraged to increase investments in energy efficiency and sustainable behaviour around energy use. However, available housing types, energetic renovation of the existing housing stock, tariff offers, and energy use patterns are all decisions that are inevitably influenced through the policy context! The optimal choice of incentive is one main way to manage energy consumption, as it can incentivize demand flexibility in the form of shifts, reduction or substitutions. While demand for energy is considered to be already flexible, we need to understand how to stir this flexibility to make load management more efficient.\nThe goal of this project is to conduct a systematic literature review that will examine the advantages and disadvantages of the individual intervention types. Specifically, by pooling upon the findings from existing studies, an estimate will be created that can shed light on the likely percentage savings per incentive type in a given context. The acceptability of a particular incentive type can also vary across different user groups depending on socio-economic characteristics and lifestyles. Thus, this context needs to be considered for the effectiveness of any type of incentive.\n\nIn a first step, you will analyze the existing literature in order to identify different intervention types for energy consumption. This list will then be used to establish a classification according to demarcations and overlaps. Next, the different social and behavioral contexts will be taken into account in order to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the individual intervention types in each context. The studies from the literature can then be pooled to establish an estimation of percentage savings per incentive for the respective adequate contexts. If possible, combined effects with financial incentives can be highlighted.\n\nJob Responsibilities:\n\nTasks:\n\nSystematic literature review\nCreate a typology of incentives\nEstablish effect sizes across the different studies\nEstimation of pooled effects\nQuantification of energy savings per incentive type\nLearning outcomes:\nPerforming a systematic literature search\nAnalyzing and synthesizing scientific literature\nUsing citation tools\nAcademic writing\n\nRequired Skills:\n\nRequirements\n\nInterest in social science topics (especially energy tariffs and user behavior) and empirical research (e.g. decision making, surveys)\nWillingness to work independently\nIdeally existing skills in working with citation tools (e.g. Zotero) or conducting literature reviews\nSoftware skills: MSO, Citation tool (Zotero etc.), Statistics (e.g. R)\n\nOther skills: Synthesis of literature, connecting ideas, interpreting results, academic writing, statistical analysis\n\nTransportation and Housing:\n\nKarlsruhe - Approximate cost of living for a student (per month)\nFood (groceries + restaurant food): about EUR 160\nRent: EUR 750\nTransportation: EUR 63\nOther expenses (telephone/internet, study materials, recreation, leisure): about EUR 130\nTelephone / Internet / radio and TV license / postage: about EUR 30\nRecreation, culture and sports: EUR 65\nLeisure activities (e.g. 1 cinema ticket with student discount): EUR 6-10\nTOTAL (approx.): EUR 1,100-1,110\n(average: EUR 1,101)\n\nCompensation and Benefits:\n\nStudents will be compensated 1,393 euros per month as a scholarship from IMPULSE-Program.\nIMPULSE - an International Mobility Program with partner universities leading in science and engineering.\n\nCampus Life @ KIT:\nKIT has a lot to offer outside of research laboratories and lecture halls.

You can read more about our analog technology at https://www.enchargeai.com/technology and about the launch of our first-generation accelerator at https://en100.enchargeai.com/.\n\nProfessor Naveen Verma (our CEO)'s lab at Princeton University spent 6 years developing the analog circuitry that eventually led him to found EnCharge along with our other co-founders Kailash Gopalakrishnan (ex-IBM Fellow) and Echere Iroaga (ex-VP MACOM).\n\nWe recently closed an oversubscribed Series B ($100 million) and are backed by Tiger Global, Anzu Partners, TSMC's VentureTech Alliance and the US Department of Defense's DARPA Program.\n\nWe're building a custom compiler for our silicon to take arbitrary PyTorch models and lower them to custom assembly for execution on EnCharge hardware. We run post-training quantization to compensate for analog noise, N-dimensional axis tiling to spatially and temporally partition large layers, algorithms to prefetch and split large frontier models larger than the size of chip memory, and more.

Be aware of mandatory and other requirements for students working outside Canada.\n\nFor specific information on the USA visa process that affects co-op employment, refer to our USA Work Permit/J-1 Visa webpage (opens in a new window).\n\nJob Summary:\n\nBackground\n\nAt Yuzu, we're building the next-generation health insurance company. We are NOT building a digital brokerage or an AI wrapper - we are going deeper to build the foundational infrastructure required to power tomorrow's health plans. We believe that software can unlock the ability to build health insurance that is affordable, adaptable, and scalable. Yuzu's platform will be core to this future.\nSo how does this actually work? Over 70% of employer-sponsored health plans are self-funded, meaning the employer acts as the insurer and directly covers employees' healthcare costs. This allows companies to customize benefits, gain flexibility, and save money. Self-funded employers partner with a Third-Party Administrator (TPA) to handle the behind-the-scenes plan administration, like processing claims and managing benefits.\nThe TPA industry is a $500bn sleeper industry that has historically been seen as a services business, bogged down by manual processes and legacy systems (for context, our team couldn't even access these on our Macs).\nYuzu is a vertically integrated & tech-enabled TPA, currently servicing thousands of employees. We differentiate by helping innovative health plans come to life by facilitating new ways to pay for and access healthcare covered by insurance. Yuzu's goal is to make it as easy for any business to create and manage a custom health plan as it is to create a storefront on Shopify.\nWe're backed by top VC firms and 10+ unicorn founders, including leaders at Stripe, OpenAI, Brex, Deel, Mercury, and Notion, and we're building a formidable team to tackle the massive opportunity ahead.\nOur Commitment to You\nYou will have significant ownership. Both equity and autonomy.\nWe will invest in your learning and forgive your mistakes along the way.\nWe will trust you and tell you everything you want to know about the business.\n\nJob Responsibilities:\n\nRole\n\nAs an early-stage startup, Yuzu's top priority is to ship software fast. We believe that the best way to ship code fast is to invest in clean code, strong CI/CD automation, and a delightful developer experience.\nWrite in Typescript using modern frameworks like SvelteKit and Nestjs\nWrite all of our infrastructure as code, improving security, modularity, and readability\nBuild on top of best-in-class healthcare APIs including Stedi and Flexpa to handle the intricacies of healthcare-specific data structures.\nHave a clean and new codebase, with little-to-no tech-debt or internal tools with steep learning curves\nAs an early employee you will\nContribute across the entire codebase\nSet a large part of Yuzu's company culture\nDirect the focus of our product from an engineering perspective\n\nRequired Skills:\n\nQualifications\n\nExperience building successful software projects, ideally independently or as a part of a small team or early-stage startup\nIn-person 5 days/week in Flatiron NYC office required\nSelf-directed, curious, fast-paced personality with strong communication skills\nNice to Haves\nExperience with Typescript, CDK, and/or AWS\nExperience in healthcare or fintech infrastructure\n\nCompensation and Benefits:\n\n$140k to $260k annual salary, plus a meaningful equity component commensurate with the level of role at a Series A company in NY/SF.\n\nTargeted Degrees and Disciplines:\n\nView Targeted Degrees and Disciplines",

As a research assistant at SEMI, you will develop data exploration and explainability methods for Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to build tools that help interdisciplinary researchers understand how LLMs represent documents from their training data (e.g. correlation structures between documents on similar topics). You will contribute to an ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration between SEMI and The Digital Democracies Institute (DDI) at Simon Fraser University. The DDI investigates the impacts of mis- and disinformation on society, including investigating the biases and effects of homogenization in language models through data influence functions.\n\nBoth of these labs are collaborating on a research project that involves tracing the influence of communities, documents, and social relations within the massive text corpora that shape the behaviour of foundation models. Building on previous and concurrent work done in influence functions and graph representation learning, you will develop and improve upon the technical challenges of storing the large corpora behind foundation models (Wikipedia, FineWeb, The Pile, etc) in a graph-augmented data-lake architecture. This project will seek to detect communities online and measure the influence they contribute to specific linguistic axes at different levels of foundation models, and create an interactive dashboard to provide humanities researchers with an exploratory visualization to give cultural-linguistic meaning to those axes.
